### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name is Graciela and I'm a geeky physicist trying to make it in the work of Data Analysis. 



- Iâ€™m currently working on a Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that involve very entry level data analysis
- You can reach me by email: physics.chick3@gmail.com
- Pronouns: She/Her
- Fun fact: I met Nobel Prize in Physics â€” Sir Andre K. Geim while I was dressed in a Banana suit.
